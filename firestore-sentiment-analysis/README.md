**Details**: Use this extension to analyze strings (for example, product reviews) written to a Cloud Firestore collection for sentiment.

This extension listens to your specified Cloud Firestore collection. If you add a string to a specified field in any document within that collection, this extension:

- Processes the sentiment of the text using Google Cloud's Natural Language Processing API. This generates the sentiment and the score for the text. More information on this API can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/basics#:~:text=Sentiment%20analysis%20response%20fields,-A%20sample%20analyzeSentiment&text=score%20of%20the%20sentiment%20ranges,%2C%20between%200.0%20and%20%2Binf%20.).
- Adds the sentiment of the string to a separate specified field in the same document.

If the original field of the document is updated, then the sentiment will be automatically updated, as well.
