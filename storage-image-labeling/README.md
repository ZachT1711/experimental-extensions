When you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier (Blaze) billing plan is required because the extension uses Cloud Vision API.

**Configuration Parameters:**

Realtime Database instances are located in `us-central1`. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).

- Cloud Storage bucket for images: To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images on which you want to perform labelling?

- Collection path: What is the path to the collection where labels will be written to.

**Cloud Functions:**

- **labelImage:** Listens to incoming Storage documents, executes image labeling on them and writes labels back to Storage into a preconfigured location.

**Access Required**:

This extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:

- storage.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to write to your Cloud Storage.)
